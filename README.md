# BookCRUD
BookCRUD demonstrates the RESTful web services using Spring MVC. BookCRUD performs all the CRUD operations. User can create a book, read a single book, update a book and delete a book. To communicate with database we will use Hibernate which is our ORM framework and MySQL is the database to store the records. 

# The app defines following CRUD APIs.
  GET /api/book
  POST /api/book
  GET /api/book/{bookId}
  PUT /api/book/{bookId}
  DELETE /api/book/{bookId}
You can test them using postman or any other rest client.
